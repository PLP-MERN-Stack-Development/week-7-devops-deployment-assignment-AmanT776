# Deployment and DevOps for MERN Applications

## ðŸš€ Deployment Process

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) of both the frontend (React) and backend (Express.js) applications.

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

- Frontend (`frontend-ci.yml`):
  - Runs on every push or pull request affecting the `frontend/` directory.
  - Installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the React app.
- Backend (`backend-ci.yml`):
  - Runs on every push or pull request affecting the `backend/` directory.
  - Installs dependencies and runs backend tests.

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)

- Frontend (`frontend-cd.yml`):
  - Triggers on every push to the `main` branch that affects the `frontend/` directory.
  - Installs dependencies, builds the React app, and deploys it to the configured platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or your custom server).
- Backend (`backend-cd.yml`):
  - Triggers on every push to the `main` branch that affects the `backend/` directory.
  - Installs dependencies, builds the backend (if needed), and deploys it to the configured platform (e.g., Heroku, Render, or your custom server).

### 3. Secrets & Configuration

- Deployment workflows require secrets (API keys, tokens, etc.) to be set in your repositoryâ€™s **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
- Example secrets:
  - For Vercel: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
  - For Heroku: `HEROKU_API_KEY`, `HEROKU_APP_NAME`, `HEROKU_EMAIL`

### 4. Customizing Deployment

- Update the deployment steps in the workflow files to match your hosting provider.
- Make sure to add any required build or environment configuration.
